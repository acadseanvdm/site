I’m grateful for the talents and opportunities given to me and wish to use them optimally, in the service of humanity. Primarily, I am grateful for the salvation granted me by Jesus Christ which fuels my spirit and drives me to give.\nI am the coordinator of the internal Statistical Consultation Unit of University of the Free State, South Africa. I also lecture Bayesian Statistics. Married to Catherine Sheares (now vdM).
