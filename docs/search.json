If no authors are listed then assume sole author.\n\n\nSASA 2025: A flexible mixed-effects quantile regression model for censored data and the longer version as presented to my department in 2025.\nMDAG Workshop 2025: Beyond multivariate applications: Quarto for reproducible interactive documents - Sean van der Merwe, Johané Nienkemper-Swanepoel, Raeesa Ganey - with my contribution being the Part 1 Slides, Part 2 Slides and a few other elements. See the workshop website for more information. This work was also presented to my department in this form.\nA 3rd research talk I did for my department in 2025 was titled A selection of consultation projects I’ve worked on recently.\nI do a crash course on ethics for the actuarial science first years at UFS, and I speak at some UFS Open Days.\nYou can download my Bayes Course Slides and materials here if you are interested in that.\n\n\n\nAt SASA 2024 I presented A quantile regression model for bounded longitudinal data and survival data - Divan A. Burger, Sean van der Merwe, Janet van Niekerk, Emmanuel Lesaffre, Antoine Pironet, again adapted from the longer version presented to my department.\nAt around the same time I presented my vision for my department in my bid for the position of academic department head to which I was appointed from 1 January 2025.\nBefore that I presented on binomial regression, or more explicitly: Flexible regression of bounded count data - Divan A. Burger, Sean van der Merwe, Emmanuel Lesaffre.\nI gave a detailed practical presentation on Generating data for assignments using R, and a light-hearted discussion of myself and my journey, called Simulation is fun, for StatSNetSA that touched on similar areas.\nAnother interesting presentation is on Visualising densities in R which includes an integration of WebR for direct computation in the browser.\nLastly, a talk on Use of AI tools in Academics that might still be slightly relevant. I gave two similar talks in 2023.\n\n\n\nOther 2023 talks include Prior selection for estimating the number of missing extreme values - Sean van der Merwe, Jan Beirlant, Andréhette Verster, both in the department and at SASA,\nand Exotic statistical modelling for real data: boerewors, river cleanup, etc..\n\n\n\nHere the focus in my SASA 2022 talk: Robust inference in the presence of censoring, skewness, and extreme values, was on a Skew-Student distribution.\nI also addressed the MBA students with an Introduction to Quantitative Research for Business Students."
